# Project-3---Interactive-Form
Form that uses unobtrusive JavaScript (it has the basic functionality even if JasvaScript is disabled) and jQuery for user interaction.
The user is unable to select activities that have the same schedule, and as he/her chooses the activies a total sum is displayed on the bottom of the field.
All the input fields have validation conditions, if the conditions aren`t met the user will not be able to sumbit the form and will get an error message for each field.
